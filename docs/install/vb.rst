VirtualBox
=================================

The PyNE VirtualBox is an Ubuntu 20.04 VirtualBox with PyNE (release 0.7.0) preinstalled. In order to setup
the VirtualBox follow these steps:

  #. Install Oracle `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_.
  #. Download the PyNE VirtualBox (.ova) file `here <https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/1kvzvh3js0enwa1j8u9dx6bdc5e4xzxn.ova>`_. 
     This file is 2.5 GB so this may take a while.
  #. Open Oracle VirtualBox. Click File -> Import Appliance, then open the `PyNE-SHA371b4b6-Ubuntu.18.04_v2.ova` file.
  #. Follow remaining onscreen instructions.
  #. The VirtualBox can then be started up by clicking the Start arrow. The PyNE installation
     is in the :code:`/home/ubuntu/.local` folder and the Pyne source can be found in
     :code:`/home/ubuntu/opt/pyne`.
  #. Email any questions to pyne-users@googlegroups.com.

The default password for the user "ubuntu" is "ubuntu" (no quotes).
